My attempts at translating the code samples in Smalltalk Best Practice
Patterns into Ruby code.

See ongoing blog post series: http://avdi.org/devblog/category/smalltalk-best-practice-patterns/

You really need a copy of the book for context if you're going to read these:
http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X/

On collaboration: so, this is kind of a personal exercise for me; I want to work through the patterns and come to my own interpretation. That said, I'm also *very* interested in other people's takes on the patterns. And I think it would be cool to put different takes side-by-side.

So feel free to fork this, and if you have a different idea on how a pattern should be translated, add it into the file with commentary (don't replace the existing content) and send me a pull request.

If you've translated patterns that I haven't gotten to yet... hmm. well, feel free to send a pull request, but for the sake of the exercise I might write my own version before I let myself look at your version.
